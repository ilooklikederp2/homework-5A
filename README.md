Missing Number Game
this file has two files one doesnt run and one runs perfectly but...
the original theme of the program was to use multiple functions with arrays and create and minipulate those arrays to be able to...
output a bunch of numbers,
then find the missing numbers in the bunch of numbers 
but essentially the program that didnt work was ment to recyle the three boards that were set up in a 2D array 
all in all one program works and one dosent but with the one that doesnt i dont know send me some ideas or maybe you could get some
